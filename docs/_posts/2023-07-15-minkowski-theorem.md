As the first post, I want to write about a very elementary but powerful theorem
called Minkowski's theorem.

<div class=theorem>
<b>Theorem (Minkowski).</b> Suppose that $$A$$ is a bounded centrally symmetric
convex set in $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ having volume strictly greater than $$2^n$$. Then
there is a lattice point in $$A$$ different from the origin.
