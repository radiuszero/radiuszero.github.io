I was recently going through Serre's *Local Fields* when
I came across this lemma and it is so neat that I can't help but
share it here.

Here is what we are going to prove:
<div class=lemma>
<b>Lemma.</b> Let \(v\) be a discrete valuation on a field \(K\)
with valuation ring \(A\), and suppose that \(K\) is complete with
respect to this discrete valuation. Let \(\mathfrak{m}\) be the maximal
ideal of \(A\) and let \(\overline{K}\) be the residue field \(A/\mathfrak{m}\).
If \(A\) and \(\overline{K}\) both have characteristic \(p\) and \(\overline{K}\) is
perfect, then \(A \cong \overline{K}[[T]]\).
