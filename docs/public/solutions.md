You can download the solutions for past Myanmar Mathematical Olympiads before in this page.
To be clear, these are the exams that were organized by the Mathematical 
Society of Myanmar from 2015 to 2019 in order to select the members for
the IMO team. As of 2023, they have been replaced by the Myanmar Open Mathematics
Competition (MOMC).

Currently, there is only one entry for Grade-11 (Tenth Standard) level exams, but
in the future I might write these for other levels as well.
