You can download my CV [here](/public/files/CV.pdf).

In addition, I have also prepared a list of descriptions of previous mathematics
courses that I have taken in CUHK, which you can find
[here](/public/files/transcript.pdf). Please be aware that the grades for the
previous semester may not be released by the university yet. If this is the
case, I will make sure to update them as soon as I know them.
