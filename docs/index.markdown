Hi! I am Kyaw Shin Thant, a junior student majoring in mathematics at the Chinese
University of Hong Kong (CUHK). My current interests are in algebraic number theory,
particularly in class field theory. I am also quite active in the math olympiad community.

On this site, I'll occasionally post some interesting proofs and theorems that I
encounter during my studies. I hope you enjoy them!
