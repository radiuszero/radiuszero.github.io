Hi! I am Kyaw Shin Thant, a junior student majoring in mathematics at the Chinese
University of Hong Kong (CUHK). My interest is in number theory. I am also quite active in the math olympiad community in 
Myanmar; I participated in the [International Mathematical Olympiad in 2019](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=29077), and since then I've been helping in training my country's IMO team. Aside from math, my other hobbies include speedcubing
and playing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate with my friends.

On this site, I'll occasionally post some interesting problems and theorems that I
encounter during my studies or elsewhere. I hope you enjoy them!
