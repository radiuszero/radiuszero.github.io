မင်္ဂလာပါခင်ဗျ။
Hi! I am Kyaw Shin Thant, an undergraduate CS student at The Chinese University
of Hong Kong (CUHK). I am planning to switch to mathematics in the coming
summer, and my current interest is in algebraic number theory. Prior to this, I
took part in the International Mathematical Olympiad in 2019. In my free time, I
like to solve olympiad geometry problems; my AoPS handle is KST2003, although
I'm not very active more due to college.

On this site, I'll occasionally post some interesting proofs and theorems that I
encounter during my studies. I hope you enjoy them!
