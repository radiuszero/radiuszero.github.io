Hi! I am Kyaw Shin Thant, an undergraduate CS student at The Chinese University
of Hong Kong (CUHK). I am going to transfer to mathematics in the coming
summer, and my current interest is in algebraic number theory. Prior to this, I
took part in the International Mathematical Olympiad in 2019. In my free time, I
like to solve olympiad geometry problems; my AoPS handle is KST2003, although
I'm not very active more due to college. Aside from math, my other hobbies
include speedcubing and playing Smash Ultimate.

On this site, I'll occasionally post some interesting proofs and theorems that I
encounter during my studies. I hope you enjoy them!
