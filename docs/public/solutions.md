You can download the solutions for past Myanmar Mathematical Olympiads on this page.
To avoid potential confusion, these are the exams that were organized by the Mathematical 
Society of Myanmar from 2015 to 2019 to select the members for
the Myanmar IMO team. As of 2023, they have been replaced with the Myanmar Open Mathematics
Competition (MOMC).

Currently, there is only one entry for Grade-11 (Tenth Standard) level exams, but
in the future I might write these for other levels as well.
