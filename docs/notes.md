I really love writing about math. Here you can find a bunch of notes, articles
and solutions that I have written throughout the years.

# MMO Solutions
These are the exams that were organized by the Mathematical Society of Myanmar
from 2015 to 2019 to select members for the Myanmar IMO team. As of 2023,
they have been replaced by the Myanmar Open Mathematics Competition (MOMC).

Currently, there is only one entry for Grade-11 (Tenth Standard) level exams which you can download [here](/public/solutions/G11Solutions.pdf). In the future I might write these for other levels as well.

# Lecture Notes
These are some of the lecture notes that I took live during mathematics courses that I
have taken in CUHK. I have edited them lightly afterwards, but inevitably some typos and errors might be still there and they are solely my fault.

*MATH5051 (Abstract Algebra I)*, Fall 2023, taught by Prof. Jiu-Kang Yu [[pdf]](/public/lecture-notes/MATH5051.pdf)

*MATH3040 (Fields and Galois Theory)*, Spring 2023, taught by Prof. Michael Mcbreen [[pdf]](/public/lecture-notes/MATH3040.pdf)

# Geometry Handouts
Here are a bunch of handouts and notes on Euclidean geometry that I wrote mostly
during the Myanmar team trainings for IMO2020 and IMO2021. They were written
primarily for internal use, so most of them are very informal and the quality varies a lot. If I have energy in the future I will try to reformat all of them, but
for now they will likely stay the same.

*Moving Points and Linearity* [[pdf]](/public/handouts/moving-points.pdf) - This is about a point moving lemma which is folklore in olympiad geometry. Not
to be confused with moving points from projective geometry.

*Some Properties of the Feuerbach Point* [[pdf]](/public/handouts/feuerbach.pdf) - The existence of the Feuerbach point is usually proven by invoking Casey's
theorem. Here, I describe a purely synthetic proof of this result and one of its
interesting properties.

*Spiral Similarities and Miquel Points* [[pdf]](/public/handouts/spiral-sim.pdf) - This is a fairly standard exposition on the spiral similarity lemma and its
applications. A lot of it is taken from Yufei Zhao's [Cyclic Quadrilaterals - The Big Picture](https://yufeizhao.com/olympiad/cyclic_quad.pdf).

*Homotheties* [[pdf]](/public/handouts/homotheties.pdf) - A very short introduction to
homotheties, and a quick synthetic proof of Monge's theorem.
